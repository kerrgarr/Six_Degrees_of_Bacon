# Six degrees of Kevin Bacon

## Objective

Create a data iterator meant to make data available to a hypothetical neural network training process.  

This hypothetical neural network would learn a person-vector embedding based on how many links are needed to get from that person to other person, as in the game, “Six Degress of Kevin Bacon.”

Graph approach to Solving the “Kevin Bacon-ator” problem!
