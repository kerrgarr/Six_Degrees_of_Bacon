## Objective

Create a data iterator meant to make data available to a hypothetical neural network training process.  

This hypothetical neural network would learn a person-vector embedding based on how many links are needed to get from that person to other person, as in the game, “Six Degress of Kevin Bacon.”


## Dataset

Dataset: Netflix Movies and TV Shows

## Background

I worked on this Python code prior to learning NLP and vector embeddings.
